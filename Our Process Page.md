**Our Process**

---

**Opening Frame**

Most agencies hand you a design and wish you luck. We build the complete system: strategy, messaging, design, development, and automations, all connected and ready to convert.

Here's how it works.

---

**Phase 1: Strategy & Architecture** *1-2 weeks*

We figure out what you're building and why before touching design.

Every project starts here. We audit what you already have, clarify your positioning and messaging, and map the customer journey from first touch to purchase. If your offer structure needs work, we sort that out too.

The goal is a clear blueprint that everything else builds on. No guessing. No "let's figure it out as we go."

**What we do:**

* Audit your existing brand, offers, and tech  
* Clarify positioning and messaging  
* Map the customer journey  
* Define offer structure (if needed)  
* Create the blueprint for the entire system

**What you walk away with:**

* Documented strategy and site architecture  
* Messaging foundation  
* System blueprint the rest of the project builds on

---

**Phase 2: The Build** *4-6 weeks*

Design, development, copy, and automations built together by one team.

This is where the system comes to life. We design the site, write the copy, build it out, and connect all the backend pieces: email sequences, automations, payment integrations, CRM. Everything built by the same team means nothing falls through the cracks.

You approve the design before we build. If you're not happy with how it looks, we keep iterating until you are.

**What we do:**

* Brand identity or refinement of existing assets  
* Website design (approved before development begins)  
* Copywriting and messaging for all pages  
* Website development  
* Email sequences and automation setup  
* CRM, payment, and tech stack integrations

**What you walk away with:**

* Complete website, designed and developed  
* Sales pages and landing pages  
* Email sequences connected and ready  
* All systems integrated and tested

---

**Phase 3: Launch & Optimize** *1-2 weeks*

We go live, watch the data, and fix what needs fixing.

Launch is the starting line. We handle final QA, get everything live, and set up analytics so you can see what's working. Then we monitor early performance and tune anything that needs attention.

We also train you on making simple updates yourself, so you're not dependent on us for every small text change.

**What we do:**

* Final QA and testing  
* Launch execution  
* Analytics and tracking setup  
* Monitor early performance  
* Identify and fix conversion leaks  
* Training on day-to-day updates

**What you walk away with:**

* Live, optimized website  
* Analytics configured and tracking  
* Training on how to manage simple updates  
* Clear picture of what's working

---

**Phase 4: Ongoing Partnership** *Monthly retainer*

We become your embedded tech team.

Most clients stay on after launch. New landing pages, email sequences, automations, tech decisions, troubleshooting. One point of contact for everything technical, without hiring in-house.

Your business evolves. Your system should too.

**What we do:**

* Ongoing support and troubleshooting  
* New landing pages, email sequences, automations as needed  
* Tech stack decisions and recommendations  
* Conversion optimization based on real data

**What you walk away with:**

* Tech partner on call  
* Continuous iteration and improvement  
* No more duct-taped fixes or random freelancers

---

**What Affects Timeline**

**Keeps projects on track:**

* Quick feedback on deliverables  
* Content and photos ready when needed  
* Clear decision-makers

**Extends timelines:**

* Multiple revision rounds  
* Waiting on photo shoots  
* Complex integrations or custom functionality

A typical full build runs 6-10 weeks. Smaller scopes move faster.

---

**What Happens After We Talk**

After our call, I put together a custom video proposal. You'll see exactly what we'd build: sitemap, page structure, features, and timeline. No guessing what you're signing up for.

**Is This Right For You?**

**This is for you if:**

* You're ready to invest in a complete system, not just a pretty design  
* You have an existing audience or a clear plan to drive traffic  
* You want a partner, not a one-time transaction  
* You're done duct-taping your tech together

**This might not be the right fit if:**

* You're looking for the cheapest option  
* You need something live in under two weeks  
* You want to maintain complete technical control yourself
