**About Page Content Outline**

**1\. Opening Frame**

Most agencies are built to hand off. Account managers, junior designers, overseas dev teams. You talk to one person, work with another, and hope nothing gets lost in translation.

Design Groove is one person. Me. I handle strategy, design, development, and automation. You get a single point of contact who understands the full picture, from positioning to launch to ongoing support.

**2\. How We Work**

**Strategy before design.** Every project starts with figuring out what we're building and why. Positioning, messaging, customer journey. The blueprint comes before the visuals.

**Everything connected.** Website, email sequences, automations, payment systems. Built by one person who understands how all the pieces talk to each other. Nothing duct-taped.

**Ongoing relationships.** Most clients stay on after launch. I become the tech partner on call. New pages, new sequences, troubleshooting, optimization. Your system evolves with your business.

**3\. Who's Behind It**

Brennan \[last name\]. Design lead turned agency owner. Self-taught. Building revenue systems for creators, consultants, and service businesses since 2019\.

I started Design Groove because I kept seeing the same problem: businesses with great offers and real audiences, held back by tech that didn't work together. Websites that looked fine but didn't convert. Funnels duct-taped together from YouTube tutorials. Email sequences that didn't connect to anything.

I fix that.
