FAQ SECTION —----

**How do I get started?** Book a call or fill out our contact form. We’ll schedule a quick intro call to align on your goals, scope, and timeline. From there, we’ll craft a tailored proposal and set a clear start date that works for both of us.

**What if I only need part of the system?** Some clients need the full build. Others need us to fix what's broken or fill specific gaps. We figure out the right scope on a call.

**What do we need to provide to get started?** Access to your existing assets (brand files, copy docs, current site) and clarity on what you're selling. If you don't have clarity on the offer yet, that's part of what we sort out in Phase 1\.

**Do you work with what I already have?** Yes. If your brand, messaging, or tech is working, we build around it. The infrastructure wraps around what's already there.

**What services does Design Groove offer?** We build complete revenue systems: strategy, positioning, brand, website, funnel, automations, and ongoing tech support. Most clients need the full build. Some need specific pieces. Either way, everything we do is designed to work together.

**How long does a project take?** Most full scope projects run 4 to 6 weeks.

**Will we have a dedicated project manager?** You work directly with me. No account managers, no handoffs, no game of telephone. One point of contact from strategy through launch and beyond.

**Do you offer ongoing support?** Most clients stay on retainer after launch for tech support, new builds, and iteration. We become your embedded tech team.
